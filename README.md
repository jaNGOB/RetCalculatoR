# RetCalculatoR


Hello and welcome :)


## Installation

When installing packages in R, we suggest Devtools. 
```
packages.install('Devtools')
library(Devtools)
```
Next our package can be installed by 
```
install_github("jaNGOB/RetCalculatoR")
```
And thats it!

Take a look at the [example](https://github.com/jaNGOB/RetCalculatoR/blob/main/notebook/example.R) located in the notebook folder.
